### R scripts to analysis Solar data from Greenwich Royal Observatory collected by R.G. Reinks
Good morning David,

I am glad you found value for analysis in SIDC data. For many years I was a contributor to that data base. Are you sending them your observational data?

On to the Greenwich Royal Observatory (GRO) data. As you can imagine, transmission of 15 million lines of text/data can be most likely accomplished via flash drive/chip or CD. The data is assembled in file folders within each category. This was done for ease of handling. The major files within the GRO file are titled: “Solar by AR#”, “Solar by CR#” and “Solar by Year.”

Solar by AR# (38.8 MB, 131 items) contains, 22 files showing AR#s and years within each file. The last file entitled: NOAA ARs 764-3535/1977-1981 Data. The 21 preceding files are GRO data beginning with “ARs 85-278.2/1874-1878 Data”. This particular file folder contains five documents, the first being titled, “AR 85-140/1874 Data.” The years 1875 through 1878 are similarly titled and contain the documents, of varying length based on the number of observation days within the titled period. I particularly enjoy this lay out as it gives a view of the lifecycle of the observed ARs, as long as they are on the visible side of the solar disc.

Solar by CR# (45.5 MB, 196 items) is similar to the above, 22 file folders showing CR#s and years within. The first, “CRs 275-337/1874-1878” contains 10 documents, the first titled, “CR 275-283 Data.” This is followed by “CR 275-283 LoVar” which uses a tables format to display Lo variation for reported ARs and then the average variation within the Carrington Rotation. The table format was added to the folders through “CRs 1142-1207/1939-1943.” This work was begun but not completed as time constraints intruded. Much of the detail work was completed while crossing the Atlantic on board the Queen Mary 2 (both ways). Sea days are perfect for finding a quiet spot with a view of the ocean while arranging data. Here you can contemplate the behavior of the sun as it relates to the delineation by Carrington Rotation.

Solar by year (56.5 MB, 265 items) encloses: 2 file folders, “SS Data 1874 to 1899 GRO” 26 items, and “SS Data 1900 to 1981 UK” 6 items. There is also: “xSS Daily Data NOAA 1982 to 2013.” There are other misc work files also prefixed with “x.” These are the source file with the addition of the CR#s. My first examination of the archived data.

So there is an overview of the contents of these files. If you wish to call, you can reach me at : 541-523-3251. I suggest between 1000 hrs to 1700hrs PDT to start.

Best regards,
Rick
